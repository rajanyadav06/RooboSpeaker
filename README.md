#Robo Speaker

This is my second project in Python, a text-to-speech program that I have named "Roobo Speaker". The program allows users to input any text they want to hear, and Robo Speaker will read it out loud to them. The user can add new text as many times as they want, and they also have the option to exit the program when they are done.

Usage:

To use Robo Speaker, simply run the rooboSpeaker.py file in your terminal. Then, enter any text you want to hear, and the program will speak it out loud to you.

Installation:

To run Robo Speaker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository and run the robo_speaker.py file in your terminal.

Future Improvements:

In the future, I plan to enhance Robo Speaker by adding more functionality, such as the ability to choose different voices, adjust the speaking speed, and save audio files. I am excited to continue working on this project and exploring the possibilities of text-to-speech technology..
